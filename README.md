# Note

This is a fork of the original repo. This version of ChatGPT Demo uses Azure OpenAI API. You can deploy this repository in Netlify, and you should set the following environment variables to make it function properly:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_URL`: the post url, which is the endpoint of your azure resource plus the route of your deployed model.

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: the API key associated with your resource.

Please turn to the original repo for more information: [ChatGPT Demo](https://github.com/anse-app/chatgpt-demo).
